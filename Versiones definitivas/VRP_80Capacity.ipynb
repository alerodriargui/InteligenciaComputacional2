    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction and Scenario Change\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment addresses the **Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity (CVRP)** under a new operational constraint. Unlike the previous scenario, the fleet capacity has been increased from 60 kg to **80 kg**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment Objective:**\n",
    "To analyze how the capacity increase affects **customer feasibility** and **route efficiency**. Specifically, we seek to integrate the customer with the highest demand (C5), who was previously excluded, and minimize the total distance traveled while serving 100% of the customer portfolio."

    "The calculated demands for the 5 customers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Customer | Demand (kg) | Status (Cap. 60) | Status (Cap. 80) |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| C1 | 18.6 | Valid | **Valid** |\n",

    "| C5 | **77.7** | *Invalid* | **Valid** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Impact of New Capacity\n",
    "The shift to 80 kg has a critical impact:\n",
    "1.  **Total Inclusion:** Customer 5 (77.7 kg) now meets the constraint ($77.7 \\le 80$). The Genetic Algorithm (GA) must now optimize a route for **5 customers** instead of 4.\n",
    "2.  **Load Saturation:** Customer 5 will occupy 97% of a truck's capacity, practically forcing an exclusive trip for them.\n",
    "3.  **Combinatorics:** The extra capacity allows for new groupings. For example, C4 (60 kg) now leaves 20 kg free, allowing it to be grouped with C1 (18.6 kg), something impossible with the 60 kg capacity."

    "\n",
    "1.  **Total Viability (C5 Included):**\n",
    "    * The most critical factor is the inclusion of **Customer 5** (77.7 kg). By increasing capacity, this customer, which previously represented a lost sale or a logistical exception, now falls within standard operational parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  **Load Optimization (High Filling Rate):**\n",
    "    * A much more efficient **fleet saturation** is observed.\n",
    "    * The combination of **Customer 4** (60 kg) with **Customer 1** (18.6 kg) totals **78.6 kg**. This represents an occupancy of **98.2%**, an ideal scenario in logistics that was mathematically impossible with the 60 kg constraint.\n",
    "    * Customer 5 occupies **97.1%** of a vehicle on their own, justifying a dedicated trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Route Consolidation:**\n",
    "    * Unlike the previous scenario where vehicles traveled with partial loads (e.g., 48 kg of 60 = 80%), here more merchandise is moved (all customers) with almost total use of available space on each trip.\n",
    "    * This demonstrates that a **33% increase in capacity** (from 60 to 80) not only allows serving larger customers but drastically improves the combinatorial efficiency of the rest of the fleet."
