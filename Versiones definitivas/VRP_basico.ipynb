    "## 1. Introduction and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this experiment is to solve a simplified version of the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** with capacity constraints (**CVRP**) using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VRP seeks to find the set of optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles departing from and returning to a depot to serve a set of customers. The goal is to **minimize the total distance traveled** by all vehicles, ensuring that the **load capacity** of each vehicle is not exceeded on any route.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Model** the VRP with capacity constraints.\n",
    "2.  **Implement** a Genetic Algorithm to find the best sequence of customers.\n",
    "3.  **Evaluate** the quality of the solution (route) using the *fitness* function (total distance).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Customers:** 5 customers are defined with their coordinates $[x, y]$.\n",
    "* **Depot:** A starting and ending point with fixed coordinates.\n",
    "* **Demand:** Each customer's demand is calculated in weight (kg) based on a list of products and quantities.\n",
    "* **Vehicle Capacity:** A fixed maximum capacity of **$60$ kg** is established.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2. Preprocessing: Customer Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial step of classifying customers into **valid** and **invalid** is performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Valid Customers:** Those whose individual demand is **less than or equal** to the vehicle's capacity.\n",
    "* **Invalid Customers:** Those whose individual demand is **greater** than the capacity. These customers are excluded from the routing problem.\n",

    "| Component | Design Decision | Explanation |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Chromosome (Individual)** | A list (permutation) of **valid customer indices**. | The *global* route is a complete sequence of customers to visit. |\n",
    "| **Fitness Function** | $\\text{fitness}(\\text{route}) = \\text{Total Distance}(\\text{route})$ | **Minimize the total distance** traveled (Euclidean distance). |\n",
    "| **Crossover Operator** | **Modified Order Crossover (OX)**. | A segment from parent 1 is kept and completed with elements from parent 2, ensuring validity (permutation without repetitions). |\n",
    "| **Mutation Operator** | **Swap**. | Two random positions in the route are swapped with a **10% probability**. |\n",
    "| **Parent Selection** | **Binary Tournament**. | Two random individuals are selected from the population, and the one with the **lowest** fitness (shortest route) is chosen for reproduction. |\n",
    "| **Population Size** | **50 Individuals**. | A constant population of 50 possible routes is maintained in each generation. |\n",
    "| **Stopping Criterion** | **200 Generations**. | The algorithm terminates after completing a fixed number of 200 iterations (generations). |\n",

    "## 4. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1. Solution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Constraint Handling:** Preprocessing that identifies Customer 5 as **Invalid** is essential, ensuring the GA only operates within a feasible solution space. The *fitness* function forces the creation of multiple trips (3 in this case) for the set of valid customers.\n",
    "2.  **GA Efficiency:** By optimizing the **visit sequence**, the Genetic Algorithm manages to find an order that minimizes total distance while considering the 'interruptions' forced by capacity. It is observed that the GA prioritizes grouping low-demand customers (C1 and C2) and isolating the limit-demand customer (C4) in their own trip, which is logically efficient.\n",
    "3.  **Fitness Function and Division Heuristic:** The fitness function intrinsically penalizes orders that force many long trips, as each trip implies two extra distance segments: **Depot $\\rightarrow$ First Customer** and **Last Customer $\\rightarrow$ Depot**. This directs the GA to search for sequences that allow multi-stop trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2. Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Division Heuristic:** The `dividir_en_rutas` function uses a simple 'first-fit' strategy. In more complex problems, a smarter division that minimizes the distance of the *individual trip* could improve the solution.\n",
    "* **Multi-Objective:** The solution only minimizes distance. A more complete VRP would also seek to **minimize the number of vehicles** (routes). The GA could be modified to include a penalty in the *fitness* for each additional route generated."

    "## 6. Final Experiment Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the genetic algorithm with a capacity constraint of **60 kg**, the following conclusions are drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Demand Loss (Invalid Customer):**\n",
    "    * The system correctly identified that **Customer 5** has a demand of **77.7 kg**, which exceeds the maximum vehicle capacity.\n",
    "    * **Conclusion:** It is impossible to satisfy this customer's demand with the current fleet. This represents a significant service loss and suggests the need for larger vehicles or allowing partial deliveries (splitting the order into two trips).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Fleet Efficiency (Underutilization):**\n",
    "    * To serve the remaining 4 valid customers, the algorithm generated **3 trips**.\n",
    "    * *Trip with C4 (60 kg):* 100% occupancy. Very efficient.\n",
    "    * *Trip with C3 (48 kg):* 80% occupancy. With only 12 kg free, C1 (18.6 kg) or C2 (22.8 kg) could not be added, forcing a new trip.\n",
    "    * **Conclusion:** The 60 kg constraint causes high route fragmentation. Many return trips to the depot are required, increasing total distance and operating costs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  **Genetic Algorithm Performance:**\n",
    "    * The GA managed to find a permutation that minimizes distance given the constraints, effectively grouping small customers (C1 and C2) where possible.\n",
    "    * However, the quality of the logistical solution is strongly limited by the physical capacity of the vehicle, not by the algorithm's optimization."
